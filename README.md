# Hi there! :wave:

My name is Maeva, and I’m a Full-Stack Web Developer.

I have 10+ years of experience in the tech industry, including 7+ years building and shipping web applications.

## Where I come from :seedling:

I'm a 100% self-taught web developer.

My career started in the video game industry, where I worked as a Game Artist. To improve my workflow, I quickly began scripting — and that’s how I discovered my passion for development.

In 2017, I took on a 3-month challenge with Google and Udacity to learn the fundamentals of Frontend Development. I earned a 6-month advanced training program, which launched my journey as a Frontend Developer.

## My philosophy :bulb:

I take a user-centric approach to development. My goal is to build products that serve end users effectively while balancing real-world constraints.

I care deeply about performance, accessibility, security, and scalability.

I enjoy teamwork and am known for strengthening collaboration between technical and non-technical teams. I also love teaching and public speaking.
